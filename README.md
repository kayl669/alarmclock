# Alarm Clock

## About

### What
NodeJS alarm clock for the Raspberry Pi (but should work on any platform).

### Goal
To provide a pleasant way to wake up, as I keep hitting snooze on all my other alarm clocks :)

### (Possible) Features
âˆš Support for multiple streams
- Enhanced error handling and backup streams/audio
- Physical snooze, next stream/track, play/pause, volume (using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins)
- Remote control (using a Spark Core, Laravel/AngularJS web interface)
- Set alarm times through Google calendar
- AirPlay support to use it as a generic audio device

## Installation

### Pi GPIO

The NPM `pigpio` requires the `pigpio` C library.
 
 ```
 wget abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpio.zip
 unzip pigpio.zip
 cd PIGPIO

 ```
