# Alarm Clock

## What
NodeJS alarm clock for the Raspberry Pi (but should work on any platform).

## Goal
To provide a pleasant way to wake up, as I keep hitting snooze on all my other alarm clocks :)

## (Possible) Features
- Multiple streams
- Enhanced error handling and backup streams/audio
- Physical snooze, next stream/track, play/pause, volume (using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins)
- Remote control (using a Spark Core, Laravel/AngularJS web interface)
- Set alarm times through Google calendar
- AirPlay support to use it as a generic audio device

## Development

### Debugging
Run `DEBUG=alarmclock:*,SebastiaanLuca:* node src/app.js` to execute and debug the application.
